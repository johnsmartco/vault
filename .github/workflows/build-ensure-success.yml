  # Github's branch protection rules for required workflow checks are a bit
  # cumbersome when you have many jobs. The required checks have to be configured
  # at the workflow job level. As child workflows of build.yml and Enos can be
  # dynamic and change often, there's no way to create or maintain a valid list
  # of workflow checks that need to succeeded in order to merge.
  #
  # To work around this problem we've chosen to trigger this workflow on
  # completion of all the jobs that are triggered by build or build-docs. This
  # workflow inspects the conclusion of the build workflow event and either passes
  # or fails. This allows our branch protection rules for the build workflow to
  # depend only on this workflow succeeding, which can only happen if all child
  # workflows of the build job have succeeded.
